# Step 7 - Conclusion and next steps

***Congratulations ! ! !***

You now know how to implement a basic viewer on your webpage to view a simple model. And you know how to customize the viewer. Take a moment to pat yourself on the back and pour yourself a celebratory glass of Code Red.

Your next step should be to request an API key and work through one of our tutorials demonstrating how to use the server-side REST API to translate a new file.

To create an API key, go to [developer.autodesk.com](http://developer.autodesk.com), click on the 'Sign in' button to sign in using your Autodesk Id (or click on the 'sign up' button to create a free Id  if you don't have one), then  click on the 'Create App' button, and follow the steps to request a key for the View and Data API.

Now you have your API key:

For a simple overview tutorial of the server-side API, go to this webpage - [http://developer-autodesk.github.io/LmvQuickStart/](http://developer-autodesk.github.io/LmvQuickStart/).

For a more detailed tutorial of creating a node.js server to allow you to upload, translate and view files, go to this GitHub repository - [https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/tutorial-getting.started-view.and.data](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/tutorial-getting.started-view.and.data).

To continue experimenting with the cient-side API, go to our [GitHub repository](http://developer-autodesk.github.io/) and start exploring samples. A good place to start is [http://developer-autodesk.github.io/LmvDbg/](http://developer-autodesk.github.io/LmvDbg/).

You'll also find lots of (smaller)s amples and code snippets on our DevBlog - [http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/).

Good luck with your 3D web development, and please don't hesitate to ask questions on our support forums if you need any help. You'll find a link to that (and other online resources) here - [http://developer-autodesk.github.io/community/#view-and-data](http://developer-autodesk.github.io/community/#view-and-data).
