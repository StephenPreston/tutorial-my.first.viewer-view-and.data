# Step 1 - Displaying a simple model

If you haven't done so already, download and unzip this tutorial somewhere on your local hard drive. You'll see that the folder structure conatins a set of folders names 'Step X', where X corresponds to the Step number on this tutorial page. Each of those folders contains the complete set of files you need to run each tutorial step. If you'd prefer to write the code as you go, then simply start in the 'Step 1' folder, and follow the instructions.

This tutorial assumes you're using Mongoose as your local webserver. If you're not, then I assume you know how to launch the index.html page in the root folder from your favorite webserver application.

If you are using Mongoose ...

Copy your Mongoose binary into the root folder of the tutorial you downloaded (the folder that contains all the "Step X' folders). Now make sure you don't have Mongoose running. If you do, right click the Mongoose icon on the menu bar (Mac OS) or in the System Tray (Windows) and select Quit. I recommend quitting Mongoose after you've finished each step of the tutorial - then you can just double-click on Mongoose again to launch the root folder index.html file in your default browser.

Double click Mongoose in the root folder to launch index.html in your default browser. Click on the 'Step 1' link on that page. When the 'Step 1' web page loads, you should see the View & Data API viewer filling the full page. 

***Note - The files in this tutorial are setup assuming that the root tutorial folder is your webroot folder. Therefore, you should always start each tutorial step by launching the root folder index.html in your browser and clicking on the link to the step you want to run.***

Congratulations! You've just launched your first View & Data API enabled webpage. :-)

Take some time to play with the viewer. Can you find and use these features:

* Zoom, pan and rotate.
* Select a component in the model (left-click).
* Isolate a component and then show all the model again (right click).
* The Explode tool.
* The Model Tree tool.
* The Object Properties panel.
